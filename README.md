# Welcome GEMINI Team to the Tuned-Do Project

Welcome to Tuned-Do, a project designed to help you manage tasks and stay organized. This README will guide you through the steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

This project provides a WEB application built with React as requested on this link: https://geminisports.notion.site/geminisports/Sr-Full-Stack-Engineer-Technical-Evaluation-811e1b6bd8ca4f5cb893bec29e4531ab.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### BEFORE TO START, RUN THE API:

Go to this [repository](https://github.com/lucaspaulodev/nestjs-gql), and follow the steps on its README to run the API of this WEB app.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucaspaulodev/tuned-do.git
cd tuned-do
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the APP

Find the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Open it and assign a value to `VITE_API_PORT=` (THE SAME THAT YOU ASSIGNED ON API_PORT FROM BACKEND PROJECT). And then, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running this command, you'll able to see on your terminal which port your WEB APP is running:
